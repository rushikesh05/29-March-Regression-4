        "* Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the model, meaning that some of the coefficients can be reduced to zero, resulting in a simpler and more interpretable model. The penalty term used in Lasso Regression is based on the absolute values of the coefficients, which is different from other regression techniques like Ridge Regression and Elastic Net Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Compared to Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression tends to produce sparser models because it encourages more coefficients to be exactly zero. Ridge Regression, on the other hand, only shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not promote sparsity. Elastic Net Regression combines both L1 and L2 norms to balance the benefits of both regularization methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lasso Regression can also be used for feature selection, which is the process of identifying and selecting the most important features in a dataset. This is because Lasso Regression can reduce the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively removing them from the model. However, it may not be the best choice for datasets with many correlated features, as it tends to select only one feature from a group of highly correlated features.\n",

The value of lambda that minimizes the information criterion is selected as the optimal value.\n",
